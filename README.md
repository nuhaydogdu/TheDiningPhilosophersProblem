# Dining Philosophers Simulation

This project is a Python application that simulates the eating thinkers problem. The eating thinkers problem is a problem that models resource sharing in multiprocessing environments. This exercise simulates a classic example where five philosophers sit around a table, each with their own plate of food and two forks.

## Technologies

- **Python:** The application is written in the Python programming language.
- **Pygame:** The Pygame library was used to create the graphical interface and animations.
- **Thread:** Python's threading module is used to allow each thread to run as a separate thread.
- **Semaphore:** The Semaphore class within the Threading module is used to control access to forks.

## How to Run

To run the application, you must have Python installed and follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project to your computer:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/nuhaydogdu/TheDiningPhilosophersProblem.git
     ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```
3. Run the application:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## Gains

- **Thread Usage:** Opportunity to understand the concept of concurrency by creating multiple threads with the Python threading module.
- **Graphical Programming:** Experience in designing user interface by creating a simple graphical interface using Pygame.
- **Resource Sharing:** Gain information on how to manage resource sharing using Semaphore.
